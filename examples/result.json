Here's what I've implemented:\n\n## âœ… Completed Improvements:\n\n1. **Shadcn-inspired Theming System**:\n   - Added CSS custom properties for colors using HSL values\n   - Implemented both light and dark themes\n   - Used shadcn's semantic color naming convention (`--primary`, `--secondary`, `--muted`, etc.)\n\n2. **Modern Color Palette**:\n   - Light theme: Clean whites and subtle grays with blue/purple accents\n   - Dark theme: Dark backgrounds with properly contrasted text and vibrant accents\n   - Improved accessibility with proper contrast ratios\n\n3. **Enhanced UI Components**:\n   - Modern card design with proper shadows and borders\n   - Improved button styling with subtle animations\n   - Better cell hover effects with overlay animations\n   - Updated typography with proper font weights\n\n4. **Theme Toggle Functionality**:\n   - Added a theme toggle button in the top-right corner\n   - Persists theme preference in localStorage\n   - Smooth transitions between themes\n\n5. **Responsive Design**:\n   - Optimized for mobile devices\n   - Proper spacing and sizing on smaller screens\n   - Maintained usability across different screen sizes\n\nThe game now features a modern, professional design that follows shadcn's design principles while maintaining the original functionality. The theme system is fully functional with both light and dark modes, and all components use the new theming variables for consistent styling.",
